Sphinx-Test-Reports
===================

``Sphinx-Test-Reports`` shows test results inside `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ documentations.

It provides the following features:

* :ref:`test-file`: Documents all test cases from a junit-based xml file.
* :ref:`test-suite`: Documents a specific test-suite and its test-cases.
* :ref:`test-case`: Documents a single test-case from a given file and suite.
* :ref:`test-report`: Creates a report from a test file, including tables and more for analysis.
* :ref:`test-results`: Creates a simple table of test cases inside a given file.
* :ref:`test-env`: Documents the used test-environment.
  Based on `tox-envreport <http://tox-envreport.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


Introduction
------------

A single documented test-case looks like this:

.. test-case:: test_add_source_parser
   :file: ../tests/doc_test/utils/pytest_sphinx_data.xml
   :suite: pytest
   :case: test_add_source_parser
   :collapse: FALSE

   Custom Message: The result is :ndf:`copy('result')` with an execution time of :ndf:`copy('time')`.

   Now follows automatically generated output like system-out, messages and text of the test-case.

Take a look into our :ref:`pytest example <example_pytest>` to see the complete result of all Sphinx tests
(:need_count:`'pytest_sphinx' in tags` test cases!).

The objects created by ``Sphinx-Test-Reports`` are based on
`Sphinx-Needs <https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
So all features for filtering, sorting and showing data is supported.

As example, here is a shorten list of tests results from the Sphinx-pytest example:

.. needtable::
   :filter: 'REPORT' in tags and type == 'testcase'
   :columns: id, title, result
   :style_row: tr_[[copy('result')]]

Sphinx-Needs Ecosystem
----------------------
In the last years, we have created additional information and extensions, which are based on or related to Sphinx-Needs:

.. grid:: 2
    :gutter: 2

    .. grid-item-card::
        :columns: 12 6 6 6
        :link: https://sphinx-needs.com
        :img-top: /_static/sphinx-needs-card.png
        :class-card: border

Other Sphinx extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During the use of Sphinx-Needs in popular companiesâ€™ internal projects,
we have created other Sphinx extensions to support the work of teams in the automotive industry:

.. grid:: 2
    :gutter: 2

    .. grid-item-card::
        :columns: 12 6 6 6

Motivation
----------
``Sphinx-Test-Reports`` was created for an automotive project, which needs to document test results and their used
environment configuration in an human-readable format.
The goal is to provide enough information to be able to setup an identical test environment in 20+ years.

``Sphinx-Test-Reports`` is part of a software bundle, which was designed to fulfill
the parameters of the `ISO 26262 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262>`_ standard
for safety critical software in automotive companies.

Other tools are:
`sphinx-needs <http://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__,
`sphinx-collections <https://sphinx-collections.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ and
`tox-envreport <http://tox-envreport.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
